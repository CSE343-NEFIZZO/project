   In the fast and tiring life brought about by urbanization, many of us have started to use the internet to order food frequently. This situation, which is both unhealthy and costly, drives us to laziness. Especially in this pandemic period, instead of going into such risky situations, we can cook easily and healthy meals at our home. We can enjoy these foods that we know what they contain. 
  
	We aim to eliminate this risky situation and make cooking fun and preferable. With this project, users can search for recipes, share recipes and communicate with other users.
